Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this

conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this

unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.

the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
</p><p>
These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to

</p><p>
Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium
but is also freely distributable.
</p><p>
The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent (now expired), GIF reading
support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified
to produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW
algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable
by all standard GIF decoders.

We are required to state that
"The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of

The following software may be included in this product: PCRE. This software contains the following license and notice below:
</p><p>
PCRE2 LICENCE
-------------
</p><p>
PCRE2 is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
</p><p>
Release 10 of PCRE2 is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as
specified below, with one exemption for certain binary redistributions. The
documentation for PCRE2, supplied in the "doc" directory, is distributed under
the same terms as the software itself. The data in the testdata directory is
not copyrighted and is in the public domain.
</p><p>
The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
included in the distribution is a just-in-time compiler that can be used to
optimize pattern matching. This is an optional feature that can be omitted when
the library is built.

EXEMPTION FOR BINARY LIBRARY-LIKE PACKAGES
------------------------------------------
</p><p>
The second condition in the BSD licence (covering binary redistributions) does
not apply all the way down a chain of software. If binary package A includes
PCRE2, it must respect the condition, but if package B is software that
includes package A, the condition is not imposed on package B unless it uses
PCRE2 independently.

as modifying the License.
</p><p>
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
</p><p>

and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

<p>PREAMBLE<p>
<p>
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide

with others.
</p>
<p>
The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
</p>
